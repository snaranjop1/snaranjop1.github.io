          I grew up in a very small town in Colombia called Manizales and moved
          to Bogot√° in 2016 to pursue higher education. I studied Systems
          Engineering at Universidad de los Andes and taught myself a little of
          UX/UI design from the internet. Making static websites is what got me
          into web development in the first place. I can never forget the sheer
          joy of putting something on the internet while I was still in college.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since the begining of my journey i‚Äôve been interested in web
          development, specially in frontend development because i love the
          UI/UX design. I also have backend development experience but the
          designer in me prefers to work in frontend.
          <br />
          <br />
          When I'm not developing, I'm either working on my side-projects or
          searching for good food spots. I'm a simple man that way üòÅ.
